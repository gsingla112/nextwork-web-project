# Introduction
This project is used for an introduction to creating and deploying a Java-based web app using AWS, espcially their CI/CD tools.

The deployment pipeline I'm using building around Java web app in this repository is invisible to the end-user, but makes a big impact by automating the software release processes.

- I'm doing this project to learn more about CI/CD and get hands on experience in automating the flow from developing code to deployed web app.
- This fits into my carrer goals.

## Technologies
Here's what I'm using for this project:

- **Amazon EC2**: Provides scalable cloud-based virtual servers to deploy and manage applications efficiently.
- Key pairs, SSH connection, Git, Maven and Java
- **VSCode**: A powerful code editor with built-in Git support, extensions, and debugging tools.
- **GitHub**: A platform for version control and collaboration, used for managing and tracking project code.
- **AWS CodeArtifact**: A secure artifact management service for storing and sharing software packages.
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Automates build processes, compiles source code, and runs tests in the cloud.
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Automates code deployment to EC2 instances, ensuring seamless updates with minimal downtime.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Orchestrates CI/CD workflows by automating the build, test, and deployment phases for faster and reliable software delivery.
